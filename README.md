This work introduces a novel application of Conditional Generative Adversarial
Networks (cGANs) for the task of generating steering angle representations from
road images, with a specific focus on road intersections. Leveraging road images as
condition labels for cGANs, our approach aims to produce steering angle outputs
that accurately capture the complexities of navigating through intersections. We
present a comprehensive methodology that integrates discriminative and generative
components of cGANs to effectively model the relationship between road images
and steering angles. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our ap-
proach in generating accurate and contextually relevant steering angle predictions
across diverse road scenarios.
